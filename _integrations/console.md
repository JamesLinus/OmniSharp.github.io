### Yeoman generators

Getting started with projects is easy using [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Here are some generators that you
can use to get started.

#### ```generator-aspnet```

The goal of [```generator-aspnet```](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet) is to provide an experience consistent with creating new ASP.NET 5 (_DNX_) projects
and files in Visual Studio 2015. Below are some other related generators that you may be interested in.

#### ```generator-csharp```

[```generator-csharp```](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-csharp) is a work in progress but is available for you to try out today. The goal of [```generator-csharp```](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-csharp) is to provide an experience consistent with creating C# projects (_MSBuild based, not DNX_) and files in Visual Studio 2015.

If you are working on a related generator please [open an issue](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet/issues/new) to let us know about it so that we can add it to the list.
